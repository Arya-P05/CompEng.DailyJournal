title: What is a Computer?
---

### Computer Hardware unit has started and lets explore what a computer really is...

**_Note to Self:_** Always generalize concepts when taking notes and makes sure to be as attentive in class as listening is also a great method to remember information.

**_What is a computer?_**

- It’s a digital machine that all of us utilize on a day-to-day basis. The computer takes in information, manipulates that information, and gives us an output. Computers can also take that information or data and it has the ability to store, retrieve, and process it.
- It is also connected to a network that has access to information from millions of different devices.

**_The black box that we see when looking at a computer is known as the case or computer cabinet._**

- A computer cabinet is a case in which all internal components are stored and organized together
- The components inside are not meant to be for everyday use, meaning they will be sharp, unlike the chassis. This also makes sure the consumer is protected because the components inside can be sharp and harmful (mentioned above as well) so the hard case is a sort of protection from that.
- The size and layout of the motherboard is what primarily decide the size of your chassis
- The main two types of motherboards are AT and ATX

**_Power Supplies_**

- 120V comes from the outlets on the wall however our day-to-day computers only need 5-12 volts and even then power supply mainly supplies the fans and the GPU. That is why we need to convert the power coming from the outlet from AC to DC and also regulate the input so it's too much more than needed.
- The AC graph is a sine graph
- This sine graph represents 0’s and 1’s as that is what the computer runs off of but this wouldn’t work because then the computer would be receiving current on and off constantly which is the main reason we use DC.
- DC - Direct Current. This direct current always lets the system stay on rather than trying on and off. It also flows only in one way, and does not alternate between 1 & 0.
- DC runs everything on a computer. We need to make sure enough power is provided to the computer, usually, 500 watts of power will work, and a good video card (GPU) requires 700W.
- The term for ‘power’ is ‘watt’
- Usually, a 500W power supply will suffice. Unless you have a good video card then probably around 700W
- Giving a larger power supply to a unit needing less power isn’t a good idea as the system won’t just take in the excess power to run faster.
- You should always make sure to check the quality of the power supply (bronze, silver, and gold) as they each lose a certain amount of power to heat and so making sure you do the math to calculate the correct amount of watts you will get is enough to power the system you are getting
- Heat being generated is the main reason for less efficiency in power supplies
- Non-modular PSU has chords already connected and restricts adding more cords etc
- A modular power supply allows customization but is more expensive. Bronze, Gold, and platinum let you know how much power supply will be lost into heat.
