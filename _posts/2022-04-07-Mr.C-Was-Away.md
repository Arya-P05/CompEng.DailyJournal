### Working on solving schematics and answering Mr. Chauhan's Exit Cards & Assignments

We were assigned exit cards and homework to complete regarding schematics today because Mr. Chauhan was absent. I completed the most exit cards in school, because of the fact that they were multiple choice and quite basic. I opted to complete the schematics tasks at home when I had more time and concentrate. The task at hand was to draw a schematic for the circuit that had been presented. I was a little puzzled with the positive/negative terminals and directions because it was my first time, but I was able to figure it out and solve the problems at the end of the day, and then also assist my other classmates with their work.
