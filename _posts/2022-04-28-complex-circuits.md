title: Beginning of Complex Circuits | April 28 - May 12
---

### Complex circuits have begun!

Now that the big game board assignment has concluded and been finished we can move onto learning about circuits like we have so far but more COMPLEX!

We began by reviewing ohm's law and then moving onto remembering back to grade 7 and 8 for circuit analysis. After the review was over we started taking up some questions. These questions started very simple and this was nice as I was able to follow along and develop an understanding for doing circuit analysis. However, Mr. Chauhan started to make them slightly harder as we went along and this was great too as we started learning how to solve circuits of all kinds no matter how tricky they may seem.

All this didn't happen in one day though, learning how to solve these circuits and becoming comfortable with them took time (around a week to be specific). I not only learned in class but also practiced outside of class at home. Me and some of my fellow classmates even started back at lunch to ask Mr. Chauhan certain questions we were still having trouble with.

So although we have been practicing these complex circuits for a week now and I feel comfortable every once in a while a certain question comes along which I can't understand. Therefore, I know I need to keep practicing!

**I've included the photos of the lesson and practice I did below as I knew they were importance to include in my journal:**
