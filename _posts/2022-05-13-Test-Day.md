### Test Day; The Best Opportunity to Learn

Today was the test for the complex circuits unit.

This is what all the practice on circuit diagrams, circuit analysis and complex circuit work has led up to. Its now or never, or at least it felt like that at the moment.

I had practiced quite a lot for this test as I knew it wouldn't be easy and the days before we had given hard questions that most of the class couldn't understand. Now although I was able to do those questions without help I knew if they were more challenging I wouldn't be able to do them, which is why I ewnt home and practiced even more.

So when it came time for the test I felt prepared and started with confidence. However, this quickly changed as the time went on as thes question were very time consuming and complicated. I managed to do 5 of the 6 questions and submit it to Mr. Chauhan at lunch as the D2L time had passed. Now the nerves set in for the results.

When Mr. Chauhan annouced the score he said the class had performed very poorly **BUT** he was willing to overlook this test if we showed hard work in the upcoming assignments.

This served as a learning curve for myself, as although I may have performed badly I was able to go back understand the material and make sure to work harder to have this grade fixed.

**Here is my practice and test calculations:**
