title: RAM, SSD & Storage Mediums Compared
---

### Different storage mediums explored today and how they all compare

**_Important Reminder:_**

- Make sure to remember that a hard drive is non-volatile way of storing information.

**RAM:**

- Volatile solid-state memory.
  - Therefore, for RAM to work, it requires voltage and as soon as you unplug it, the information goes away
- Data that is in current use can be made more accessible by temporarily storing it in Random-Access Memory
  - RAM stands for Random-Access Memory
- The computer has to store its bits somewhere and that is where RAM comes into play
- RAM is a solid-state and much faster to access than a hard drive. There are no moving parts so that makes it faster than a hard drive with moving parts.
- RAM has gotten quite inexpensive
- You cannot use RAM as your only storage source because whenever you start a computer you need to load up the operating system but if that would be stored in RAM then you would wipe it every time you shut your computer down so it would be impossible to use RAM as your only source as storage.
  - Not technically impossible but it would be a very dull idea to only have RAM
- The more RAM you have, the fewer applications must access the HD; you see more speed, especially with multiple apps
  - That is why if your system is slow the first thing you should try is to upgrade the RAM. RAM upgrades are an easy, inexpensive way to improve the performance of your computer

**Solid State Drives:**

- Regardless of the amount of RAM, the OS (operating system) is always loaded from non-volatile storage (the hard drive)
  - Most of the time spent waiting for boot up is due to loading time from the hard drive
  - Leading the OS and any other heavy-use applications to be stored on a solid-state hard drive as that will improve performance
- With no moving parts, SSDs also have the advantage of greater durability and less power consumption
- **BUT**; They are not designed to be re-written over and over again. So, we want to keep data stored on it for a longer period of time
  - If you lose your data and want to get it back through a recovery company, depending on how encrypted it was it might cost you $100 to $500 per MB of data you want to recover
  - We covered an example of how much it would cost someone to recover 50GB of data and that would turn out to be $50 million!!
- Moore’s Law is very applicable to SSDs as they are always being improved upon

**Are SSDs Hard Drives?**

- Yes: They are non-volatile
- Yes: They are rewritable
- Yes: They can contain your computers OS
- No: They are not magnetic storage, they are flash memory
- No: They aren't disks

**Comparing Speeds:**

- Boot-up time (Windows 10): 30-seconds (SSD), 1-minute 15-second time (HDD)
- Data read-write speed: 510-550 megabytes per second (SSD), 50-150 megabytes per second (HDD)
- Excel file open speed: 4 seconds (SSD), 14 seconds (HDD)

**Durability Issues:**

- Backups are a critical aspect of safe computing
- Could storage and network drives ensure that the short life of the hard drive doesn’t need to cause significant problems to your storage capacities

**Safe disposal of Hard Drives:**

- Non-volatile was so exciting, but there is a downfall
- A great deal of information can be left on a hard drive even after reformatting it
  - So when Mr. Chauhan used to work as Honeywell there was a department whose only job was to format the hard drives of the company and they would load garbage onto the entire hard drive 7 times to ensure any data can’t be retrieved
- Windows and MAC OS have utilities to write random 1s and 0s
- You can also fill the drive with videos of cats
- Even physical destruction may not be enough - acid is the only truly sure way to ensure everything is gone
