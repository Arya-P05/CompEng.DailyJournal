title: Water Works Assignment | May 20 - 27

### Problem Solving & Real World Components Together

We have been introducted to the final assignment of this course before the final summative and its very complicated when first looking at it. We are to create a circuit which will warn us using LED's and a buzzer of the rising water levels. We will be doing this assignment in 3 components: Schematic (TinkerCAD) -> breadboard with switches -> circuit tested with real water.

**Components Required for Water Warning System**

- 4 - NPN transistors (3904 for in class - Tinkercad only has one NPN \*\* BC547 & 2N3904 are interchangable)
- 8 - 470 ohm resistors
- 4 - Colour LEDs - red, green, and yellow
- 1 â€“ Buzzer (Buzzers have POLARITY + & - \*\* Hint Like LED they go in one direction)
- 1 - 9v battery
- Breadboard

Using these components I was able to create a schematic on TinkerCAD using the actual schematic given to us by Mr. Chauhan:

By creating this schematic on TinkerCad it made it much easier to create the physical circuit on the breadboard as I just had to follow my correct and working design. Now it came time to actually build and this as easy as like I mentioned I just had to build physically what I had designed.

Now when it came test our project with real water it was quite nerve-wreaking! Growing up I've always been told to keep electronics away from water and now I'm being asked to build a circuit to put into water. Which evidently had me quite surprised but I understood the concept quite quicly. After understanding I made my circuit much smaller and took the buttons out as now the water level would turn my LED's on. After working on this for a couple of days in between my Ultimate Frisbee OFSAA tournament days I was able to finish the assignment with it working perfectly! I soon tested it with Mr. Chauhan and it was perfect, proving my correct completion of the assignment.
