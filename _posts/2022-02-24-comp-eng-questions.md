### Today we were split into groups to do an in-class assignment

I personally liked this assignment very much as it was my first time working in a group with the other classmates and it gave me not only a chance to better understand the course material but to make new friends as this was my first in-person semester at Castlebrooke.

- As per the assignment itself I was able to learn in-depth about the following:
  - HHD+SSD vs. RAM
  - DRAM vs. SRAM
  - Uses of DRAM and SRAM
  - Choosing the correct RAM --- How do I do that?
  - RAM Technical Specifications
  - ROM
  - Leakage Property for SRAM & DRAM
  - What is Flip-Flop Configuration?
  - What is the difference between latency and speed (RAM)?
  - What is firmware?

Below is my groups assignment docmument with the questions and answers, make sure to take a look:
