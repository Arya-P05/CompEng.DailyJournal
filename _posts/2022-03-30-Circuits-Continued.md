### Today we'll continue into the circuits unit and discuss resistance and resistors.

- Series Circuit have only one path meaning if one thing breaks everything stops working
- Electrons choose the path of least resistance
- Resistance in parallel is calcualted using the following formula: 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 ...

## Resistance and Resistors

- Total resistance is calculated in a series circuit when all the resistance is simply added together.

  - Ex. A series circuit has the following 3 resistors:
  
    - Resistor 1 - 470 ohms
    
    - Resistor 2 - 780 ohms
    
    - Resistor 3 - 220 ohms
    
  - Therefore to calculate the resistance of that series circuit we would simply add the resistance together.
  
  - Total Resistance = 470 ohms + 780 ohms + 220 ohms = 1470 ohms

- An important detail to remember when designing/making circuits is when too many devices or loads are added to a circuit the current gets lower and lower to the point where it may not be able to support the number of devices on that circuit

- The **key** difference between parallel and series circuits is there are multiple paths the current can take in a parallel circuit whereas there is only 1 path for the current to take in a series circuit.

  - A big and very commonly known downside to series circuits is because of the mentioned path above. Since there is only 1 path the current can flow in a series circuit if one load breaks the whole circuit will break.
  
  - Whereas a big advantage for parallel circuits is the current has multiple paths as mentioned but because of this the current chooses the path of least resistance
  
- Total resistance is calculated in a parallel circuit when all the resistance is added together **BUT** it is done as 1/x where x represents the resistance of the resistor.

  - Ex. A parallel circuit has the following 3 resistors:
  
    - Resistor 1 - 470 ohms
    
    - Resistor 2 - 780 ohms
    
    - Resistor 3 - 220 ohms
  
  - Therefore to calculate the resistance of that parallel circuit we would simply add the resistance together remembering to have the resistance under a 1 as follows: 1/x.
  
  - Total Resistance = 1/470 ohms + 1/780 ohms + 1/220 ohms = 1/1470 ohms = 125.7044 ohms
