### The CPU & BIOS test is happening today!

After all the groups presented this week from Monday to Thursday we now have our test on BIOS and CPU and it incompasses the information which was on all of the groups presentations.

I was quite confident going into this test, as I've always done well on tests throughout high-school and I also had prepared a lot for this test. Althought when I got to class that morning I had the butterflys set into my stomach, I was all of a sudden feeling very nervous as I remembered that although I studied hard I had to answer 57 questions!

However, the hard work paid off! I was able to score a **_56/57_** on the test and although I wish I had a perfect score I was more than glad with this mark. In the end, I knew I had successfully applied and retained the information we were taught and researched about the BIOS and CPU.
