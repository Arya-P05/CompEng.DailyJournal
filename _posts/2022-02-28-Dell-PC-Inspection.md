### First hands-on task/assignment

As this was the first hands-on task we got to do in class with the technology avaliable to us it was very exciting as we had to open up a PC in pairs and identify all the parts that we have been learning about in the past.

I was paired up with Samardeep.

This assignment was very exciting as I got to do something I have never done before and put the knowledge we have been talking about over the last few weeks into real-life tasks.
