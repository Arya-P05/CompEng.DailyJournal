title: Actual Beginning of Computer Engineering

### Brief Introduction to Computer Engineering:

- Transistors can amplify an electrical current
- Moore's law: “every 2 years, the number of transistors on a chip doubles”
  - This implies computers double-speed every 2 years, or a computer will get smaller.
- This can trigger revolutions such as a Stuxnet worm (virus) that spread in Iran's uranium enrichment facility, delaying their nuclear facility.
  - The worm targeted Iran's PLC(Programmable Logic Controller).
- 2012 curiosity rover, survived 4 years on mars without communication to earth 90% of the time.
- 2016 self-driving vehicle tests in Ontario, making devices smart.
- Computer engineering includes a lot of robotics, automation, decision systems, sensors, device design, and computer design.
  - Skills needed include problem analysis, system design, troubleshooting and logic, circuit construction, programming, analytics and decision support, project management, documentation, and math.
- Objective: think inside the box, “why does this work the way it works”
  - Now imply this thought process on your day-to-day devices such as your phone, laptop, computers, etc.
