title: Display Circuit Board Project | April 8 - April 27
---

### Arya's journey throughout his display board assignment!

Introduction to the **Display Board Assignment** was done on April 8th.

**First Thoughts:**

- The instructions and expections were the following:

  1. Design Circuit

     - At Minimum :- Require 8 Switch , 4 LED , 1 Current limiting Resistor (470 Ohms), 9V potential

  2. Design the circuit on tinkercad and make sure it works

  3. Two buttons when pushed together need to trigger an LED

  4. Now think of the game - How would you design it

  5. Lay out of your switch / LED on the board ( Might need appropriate holes drilled etc .)

  6. Design your OWN switch

  7. Prints graphics and create your schematics according to the layout for the switch and LED - Draw Schematic behind the board ( Remember to follow all the rules of proper Schematic Drawing)

  8. Proper and secure connections

  9. Final test

- This is a very exciting project as I will be able to demonstrate my understanding of cuting, stripping and joining wire, working with electronic components and self-made switches. It will allow me to express my creativity along with my technical engineering skills which I have learned through this class.

- I have a breif idea of what I wish to do with this project but nothing certain thus far.

**Currently I have gathered inspiration which I have shown below:**

**After Completion Reflection/Thoughts:**

This project could be described as a **_ROLLARCOSTER_**! It had both its ups and downs. I was very optimistic at the beginning and was making very good progess as I went along, as I had a great idea and the schematic I made on TinkerCAD was loved by Mr. Chauhan. However, things took a turn when it came to building the circuit in real life. It became a lot more complex and as this was my first time dealing with wires and circuits it was very daunting. But I persevered through and at the end was able to come up with a beautiful project which looked great but also worked. Now this doesn't mean I couldn't improve my final product, I could've improved my switches and not have them always connecting and relying on their light weight to function. I could have took the solid foil strip away and put a small section in the middle. However as I worked hard and Mr, Chauhan understood that he gave me a 47/50 on this assignment which I feel is fair. I could have improved and this justified the loss of marks and this was a great learning oppourtunity for me as well! Overall this project was very fun to do and a great chance to learn about circuits hands-on!
