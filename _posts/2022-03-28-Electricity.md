### Today we'll discuss electricity and how it is found within the circuit.

**Static Electricity**

- Static electricity is a familiar electric phenomenon in which charged particles are transferred from one body to another. For example, if two objects are rubbed together, especially if the objects are insulators and the surrounding air is dry, the objects acquire equal and opposite charges and an attractive force develops between them. The object that loses electrons becomes positively charged, and the other becomes negatively charged. The force is simply the attraction between charges of opposite sign. The properties of this force were described above; they are incorporated in the mathematical relationship known as Coulomb’s law.

**Current - Electricity in motion**

- Current or dynamic electricity is defined as an electrical charge in motion. 
- It consists of a flow of negatively charged electrons from atom to atom through a conductor in an electrical circuit.
- It's measured in amperes (sometimes called amps)
  - Current moves through a circuit
- 1 ampere = 1 coulomb/speed
- We usually show current as an arrow from + to - (conventional current)
  - Current moves through a circuit
- A circuit contains:
  - Potential source, conductor, load

**Potential Difference: A battery or a power supply provides a force to push current around a circuit**

- We call this force potential difference or potential
- The units of potential are volts
- When we apply a potential, we often say we’re applying a voltage
- The symbol for the battery is: + (longer),- (shorter)

**Resistance**:

- Any circuit other than a short circuit will resist the flow of electricity
- The component in the circuit that contributes resistance is often called the load.
- The resistance may be based on work done by a device on a circuit like a motor or based on the kind of material
- Resistance is measured in ohms, with the symbol

**Short Circuits**:

- Circuits without a load allow electricity to flow unrestricted, it won’t slow down
- There are many reasons why this isn’t good.
- Most (All?) components in circuits have maximum current ratings.
- If these are exceeded, components burn out.
- Batteries can explode if their maximum current levels are exceeded.
  - Never connect the positive and negative terminal of a battery without a load.

**The Three Things that make up a circuit**:

- Potential source (battery)
- Load (resistor)
- Conductor to connect them together

**Ohm’s Law**:

- There is a very simple relationship between current, potential, and resistance:
  - I = V/R
  - V = I\*R
  - R = V/I
- The current goes up when the voltage goes up, and the current goes down when the resistance goes up.

**_OHM = RESISTOR (R)_**

**_AMPERES = CURRENT (I)_**

**_VOLTS = VOLTAGE (V)_**

**Key Points**:

- Potential is the force that is pushing electrons through the circuit, measured in volts.
