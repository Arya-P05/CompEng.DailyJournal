title: Circuit Schematics

### Today we'll discuss curcit schematics in depth and with images.

- How do we present our own designs accurately?
  - Communication is a critical part of any circuit schematic
  - Text-based communication is not effective with 3-dimensional systems which is why we use a more pictorial-based approach
  - We need these pictorial representations to be able to communicate circuits
  - We have a set of universal symbols that are used in schematics to allow everyone to understand what each circuit means without having to use different mbols each time
- There are certain acknowledged processes for reviewing other people's schematics, just as there are for documents.
- A Good Schematic Includes:
  - Patent documents
  - Communication with coworkers
  - Accurate prototypes
- **ALWAYS REMEMBER** At best, a bad schematic is inconvenient; at worst, it can be dangerous.
  - Transistor = Switch and Amplifier
  - (BATTERY/CAPACITOR) = (POSITIVE IS A LONGER LINE)
- The transistor is a term that refers to both a switch and an amplifier.

**The Basic Layout**

- Lines represent wires
- Dots represent conductive “joins”
- Intersections are NOT connections unless it's’ the only options

**The Power Supply**

- The source of potential
- Usually, it is direct (DC)
- Single-cell: 1.5 V implied
- Usually, the voltage is written beside the battery
- The larger bar represents the positive terminal of the battery

**Labeling:**

- Vcc
- Positive voltage
- Hot
- Red Wire
  - In general, circuits have power at the top of the circuit.

**The Ground**

- Source of electrons
- 0.0 V
- Negative terminal
- Smaller pole of the battery symbol
- Usually at the bottom of the circuit

**Wires:**

- Lines on the schematic represent wires.
- Schematics generally have wires drawn vertically and horizontally.

**Current Flow: Conventional (or electron flow)**

- The direction of the current flow is positive to negative
- Source of ground
- In any simple circuit (series), current flows the same across any points in the circuit.
