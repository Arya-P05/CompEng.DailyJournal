title: Introduction To Drivers

### A new chapter in our Computer Engineering journey

Today we will be continuing on from the question Mr. Chauhan asked us at the end of yesterday's class: “How can we connect devices (both input and output) onto the motherboard?” The answer to that would be DRIVERS. Drivers are the topic of today's lessons so let's take a deeper understanding:

**Every Hardware Device Needs an Interpreter**

- While there are some standard modes of communication between the computer and devices, there are some things that are unique
- Each OS needs to be “taught”

**Developing New Hardware**

- When manufacturers develop a new piece of hardware, they have to divide who should be able to use it
  - Platform - Linux PC, Windows PC, Apple, custom devices (?)
  - Version - Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, etc.
  - Architecture - 32 bit, 64 bit, etc.
- For every platform/version/architecture combination, there needs to be a unique driver coded
- For this reason, some hardware manufacturers will make the decision not to support some OSs or even platforms

**Finding the Right Driver**

- Modern operating systems are designed to find the right driver automatically
- For Windows 10, it does it automatically or...
  - Start by “add a device” or follow the wizard
- This will work if the computer is on the internet and if the device is configured appropriately
- In some cases however it is not possible to use this tool
- We have to manually search for the driver online
  - Get this from the manufactures website

**Generic Windows Installations**

- Installing windows can result in disabling (partially or completely) key components like network and graphics cards
- We may need to locate and download the drivers for these things before our display and internet will work correctly
- When savvy computer users re-install Windows, they make sure that they have all their drivers on a USB before they start

**But the original purchaser didn’t have to do this!**

- Microsoft has an agreement with computer manufacturers
  - OEM copies of Windows include key drivers for specific machines on the install disc and/or Windows is pre-installed
- If you buy a computer, make sure that you make a backup of YOUR version of Windows
- and keep it safe
- These unique versions of Windows are referred to as ‘ISOs’

**Best Practices 1 & 2**

- When you buy a new computer (package) it has an OS
- It’s often pre-installed; no backup included!
- As soon as you purchase the computer, go to the manufacturer’s website and download the ISO for your computer, using (typically) the serial number for the computer
- Save its OS on an external piece of memory, and keep it safe. It contains all the drivers for your computer
- IT IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL
- The day that you start using your computer, it starts deviating from the default settings that are on the install disc
- Every new piece of hardware or change in setting represents work that will be lost if the Windows install is corrupted
- Windows System Image is designed to help with this. You can create a backup of your entire system (typically on a spare hard drive)

**What if I Didn’t Make a Copy?**

- Manufacturers are supposed to retain copies of their Windows ISO
- If you have your registration numbers, you should be able to go to the manufacturer’s site and download the correct ISO
- Windows 7 ISOs are generally still available from the manufacturer
- Microsoft retired Windows 7 in 2020, yet you can still find the ISO if you want it

**Troubleshooting Hardware**

- When hardware stops working, on et=potential cause is a corrupted driver
- Before you replace the component, it’s worth a try to update or reinstall the driver for this component

**Printer Drivers - a Tip**

- Many printer manufacturers have started offering “universal print drivers” that are supposed to work for all of their hardware
- If possible, avoid this. The technology does not seem to be robust at this time. Install the driver that is specific to your printer

**Finding the Drivers**

- In google, search:
  - The exact computer you have: e.g. “Lenovo spiffy 512”
  - The operating system you’re installing: e.g. “Windows 3.1”
  - The thing you need: e.g. “HP blah blah blah Printer driver”
  - Make use of good keywords
