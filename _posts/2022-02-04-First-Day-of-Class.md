### First Thoughts and Opinions on Mr. Chauhan & Computer Engineering

Mr. Chauhan has a great attitude, uplifting spirit, and is very positive _[it's gonna be a great semester in his class]_ :)

**_Main Rules of This Class:_**

- Respecting the teacher and the other students is **VERY IMPORTANT**.
- Always ask questions, donâ€™t be afraid to ask because you feel that the other students might judge you.
