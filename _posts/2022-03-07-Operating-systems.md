title: Hands-On Operating System Assignment | March 7 - March 11
---

### Time to put our knowledge on operating systems to a practical test!

During these days, I, Krish and Dhiarya worked (hands-on) with the OS. We identified the steps to download the Ubuntu (Linux) OS and Windows 10 OS onto a USB to load on the provided PC. Which included us having to first wipe the computer of windows first and then install this new operating software (Ubuntu) onto the computer.

Being able to do this was very informative and also very enjoyable. I am very happy with the real-world applications of this class and being fortunate enough to experience all this.

After doing this task successfully, I was able to help out other groups, students, and Mr. Chauhan with certain troubleshooting tasks on the computers. I was also able to learn a lot more about how computers work and how to solve many issues with Mr. Chauhanâ€™s guidance and real hands-on experience. Mr. Chauhan really spent time to help me understand certain things and I am very appreciative of the work and learning I have been able to do by being alongside him and in his class.

**Thank you for all your help and understanding today Mr. Chauhan**

- It means a lot to know I have a teacher who is willing to help me understand the material without brushing me off :)
