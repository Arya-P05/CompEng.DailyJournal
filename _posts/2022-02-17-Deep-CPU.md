### CPU Continued In Depth

- We started off today’s lesson by watching an informative video on everything we need to know about CPUs, bits, etc. Video Linked below for direct information:

- ‘Load’, ‘in’, and ‘add’ are the most basic function that the CPU does
- The motherboard holds the CPU using a socket
- Land grid array and Pin grid array are the two main types of pin connectors, making sure not to damage any of these pins is extremely vital as even 1 pin being damaged will ruin the motherboard or the CPU

**System Clock:**

- Your system clock would almost be like a heartbeat
- If you take a quartz crystal and if you apply a small voltage it will start vibrating
- The idea behind it is that when it vibrates it creates these pulses that we can use to
- 4 transistors in our CPU, when a pulse happens is that all of them turn on and every time new data is sent using these pulses. (With each pulse CPU does 1 function or step)

**Buses:**

- Buses more information around the motherboard
- Usually, they broadcast (all components see the signal)
- No system is individual they are all connected to each other either directly or in-directly

Bus interconnection Scheme:

**Data Bus:**

- Moves data (or instructions)
- The width of the bus determines the speed at which data moves (in combination with the system clock). Think about it as a bus on a highway if there are 10 buses on a single-lane highway it takes longer for them to transport the data compared to a highway with multiple lanes.
- Width is measured in bits (32-bits means 32 bits per cycle)
- Maybe 8, 16, 32, 64-bit

**Address Bus:**

- Identifies the source or destination of data
- e.g. CPU needs to read an instruction (data) from a given location in the memory
- CPU sends the data location to the memory and it knows to release this data from that location
- Bus width determines the maximum memory capacity of the system. e.g. 8080 has a 16-bit address bus giving 64k address space

**Control Bus:**

- Control and timing information
  - memory read/write signal
  - Interrupt request
  - Clock signals
  - So for simplicity let's look at an example, where the CPU requests information from a given memory
