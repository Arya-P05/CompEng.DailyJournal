title: Resistor Sorting | April 4 - 6

### 3 Days of sorting, identifying and analysing resistors

**Identifying Resistor Values**
You are able to tell the resistance a certain resistor provides by looking at the coloured strips on a resistor. They each indicate a certain value and when put together you are given the final resistance that resistor provides to a circuit.

**_It is explained perfectly through this diagram I made:_**

**3 Days of Sorting**
Using this method of idenfying the resistance value our class was tasked to sroting all the resistors in our Computer Engineering class. This task took us 3 days and although it became very tedious and fustrating at times, at the end of it I was able to tell resistance values ery quicky and even had some colour patterns memorized!
