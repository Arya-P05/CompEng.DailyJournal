### Digital FootPrint & First Assignment Introduced

Mr. Chauhan talked about making sure to enjoy learning in his class and that idea of learning while having fun is very appealing to me.

**Can you live off the grid?**

- I (Arya) personally couldn’t as my life is so intertwined with technology these days that I couldn’t imagine life without technology

**What makes a creditable source?**

- Publications that back up or cite their data, websites that end in .org or .gov.
- Keep this in mind when working on assignments

**Importance of digital citizenship:**

- We leave a footprint everywhere we go
  - Which can not only put our safety in danger due to geotagging, stalking, and lack of privacy.
  - This will also affect our future and current self due to the content posted in both positive and negative ways.
- When we post pictures, they may have a geotag which can be traced back to your near-exact location, and this can pose a great security threat to those around you and yourself, especially if you are a school student.
  - Moreover, if your account is public or you accept unknown accounts to follow you, they can also stalk you, write inappropriate comments, or even try to groom and catfish you as a child, this lack of privacy is a great danger if you are not responsible online.
- Content posted online will always remain a part of us.
  - A great example of this was given by Mr. Chauhan about an employee in his prior company who was let go after the company discovered an inappropriate video of her in her teens.
  - This goes to show that what you do at any age online will remain a part of you.
  - Although this does not only work negatively it can also be positive, say you were to post yourself volunteering and being a global citizen, this is the kind of environment any employer would want to build, and this can work for you, as long as you use social media positively.
- In all, be responsible when using social media as that is how you portray yourself to the world, and nothing is ever deleted once posted.
  - Be accountable and responsible, and that will make you a great digital citizen.

**Digital Citizenship Assignment:**

- Make a 2-3 minute video on digital citizenship and the top 2-5 will be shown in class
